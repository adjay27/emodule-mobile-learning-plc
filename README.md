# E-Module Mobile Learning PLC - Documentation

**Project Name**: E-Module Mobile Learning PLC  
**Description**: The "E-Module Mobile Learning PLC" app is an educational Android application designed to help students learn about programming logic controllers (PLC) on their smartphones. Developed using Android Studio, this app serves as a mobile-friendly e-learning platform, offering interactive modules, tutorials, and exercises focused on PLC programming concepts.

## Project Structure

### 1. **App Modules**

- **Home**: Main screen providing access to all sections of the app.
- **Lessons**: Contains structured learning modules on PLC basics, programming concepts, and practical exercises.
- **Quizzes**: A set of quizzes to test the userâ€™s understanding of PLC concepts.
- **Simulations**: Interactive tools to visualize and simulate PLC programming examples.
- **Settings**: Allows users to customize their app experience, such as adjusting font size or toggling notifications.

### 2. **Features**

- **Interactive Modules**: The app includes various learning modules that cover the basics of PLC programming, such as ladder logic, boolean operations, timers, and counters.
- **Quizzes & Tests**: After each module, quizzes allow students to self-evaluate and reinforce their learning.
- **Simulations**: Users can experiment with PLC programming principles through simulations, which provide practical insight into real-world applications.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app tracks the user's progress, marking completed modules and displaying scores for quizzes.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The app is optimized for ease of navigation and usability on Android smartphones.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin (or Java, if applicable)
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to ensure modularity and reusability
- **Database**: SQLite or Room for storing user progress and quiz scores locally
- **API Integration**: (Optional) If any external resources are used, such as pulling additional lessons or PLC-related content from online sources.

## Installation Guide

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Android Studio (latest version recommended)
   - Android SDK and Emulator

2. **Setup**:

   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/e-module-mobile-learning-plc.git`
